# The Architects Take Home

Objective: Use Age of Empires II api to pick two units, have them battle, and display the results.

API: https://age-of-empires-2-api.herokuapp.com/docs/

Required Tasks:
- Use React
- Be able to choose 2 different units.
- Display a button that causes selected units to fight when pressed.
- Display results.

Tips:
- Use lots of small commits with descriptive names.
- There is a lot of info that comes back with each unit. For the fighting, choose a few properties to use. i.e. attack, hit_points, and reload_time.
- Don't spend too much time on design. Simple is completely fine.
